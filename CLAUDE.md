# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Stremio addon proxy that routes Real-Debrid streaming links from Torrentio through your own server. The proxy serves two main purposes:
1. **IP Masking**: All Real-Debrid traffic appears to come from a single server IP, regardless of which client is streaming
2. **URL Caching**: Resolved Real-Debrid URLs are cached to improve loading times and reduce API calls to Torrentio

## Implementation

This project is implemented in **Rust** for optimal performance and security:
- **Low memory footprint**: 2-5MB runtime
- **Fast startup**: <1ms
- **Production-ready**: All security features implemented
- **Source**: `src/main.rs`

> **Note**: A legacy Node.js implementation previously existed but was removed due to critical security vulnerabilities (no path sanitization, timing attack vulnerabilities, API key exposure in logs, no SSRF protection). See FINAL_REVIEW.md for details.

## Architecture

### Request Flow

1. **Manifest Request** (`/manifest.json`): Stremio requests the addon manifest to install the addon
2. **Stream Request** (`/stream/:type/:id.json`): Stremio requests available streams for a movie/series
   - Proxy forwards request to configured `TORRENTIO_URL`
   - Rewrites Real-Debrid URLs to point to this proxy server
   - Returns modified stream list to Stremio
3. **Stream Proxy** (`/resolve/realdebrid/*`): Stremio attempts to play a stream
   - First resolves actual Real-Debrid URL from Torrentio (using HEAD request to get redirect)
   - Caches the resolved URL in `resolvedUrlCache` Map
   - Proxies video data from Real-Debrid to the client
   - Handles HTTP range requests for seeking
   - Implements 5-minute idle timeout to prevent hanging connections

### Key Components

#### Rust Implementation (src/main.rs)

**Configuration (load_config)** - Loads and validates environment variables
- Normalizes `TORRENTIO_URL` (strips `stremio://` prefix and `/manifest.json` suffix)
- Validates required environment variables on startup
- Returns validated Config struct

**Middleware**
- `logging_middleware`: Logs all incoming requests with timestamp (only in debug mode)
- `api_key_middleware`: Validates API key with **constant-time comparison** (returns 403 on failure)
  - Uses `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` to prevent timing attacks
  - API keys stored as `Vec<u8>` for byte-level comparison
- CORS and tracing layers for production-ready operation

**Endpoints**
- `manifest_handler`: Returns static Stremio addon manifest
- `stream_handler`: Fetches streams from Torrentio and rewrites RD URLs
- `proxy_handler`: Proxies video streams with caching and timeout

**Caching & Streaming**
- `resolved_url_cache`: Thread-safe **Moka LRU cache** with TTL storing remotePath â†’ actual RD URL
  - Max capacity: 1000 entries
  - TTL: 1 hour (automatic expiration)
  - Proper LRU eviction algorithm
- `resolve_locks`: Thread-safe **Moka sync cache** with TTL to prevent **thundering herd** on cache misses
  - Max capacity: 1000 entries
  - TTL: 5 minutes (prevents memory leak from unbounded growth)
  - Only one request resolves a given URL at a time
  - Double-checked locking pattern for efficiency
  - **Fixed**: Previously used unbounded HashMap causing memory leak
- `resolve_rd_url()`: Follows Torrentio redirect to get actual RD URL
- `try_proxy_stream_with_fallback()`: Handles streaming with automatic retry on 404
- Uses tokio timeouts (5 min) for request management
- Streams response body chunk-by-chunk for memory efficiency

**Security Features**
- **SSRF Protection**: Domain whitelist for TORRENTIO_URL (validated at startup)
  - Allowed domains: torrentio.strem.fun, torrentio.strem.io, torrentio-debrid.cloud
  - **Multi-domain support**: Dynamic `torrentio_base_url` extracted from config (not hardcoded)
- **Path Traversal Protection**: `sanitize_path()` validates all incoming paths
  - Rejects `..` and `//` patterns
  - Validates only safe characters (alphanumeric, `/`, `-`, `_`, `.`)
- **Timing Attack Prevention**: Constant-time API key comparison using `subtle` crate
- **Log Sanitization**: `sanitize_uri_for_logging()` strips query parameters from logs
  - **Fixed**: Prevents API key exposure in authentication failure logs
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized and validated
- **Docker Security**: Runs as non-root user (UID 1000) in all Dockerfiles

**Memory Efficiency**
- Uses Moka LRU cache with bounded memory (max 1000 entries)
- Streams video data without buffering entire files
- Static binary with minimal runtime overhead
- Alpine/scratch Docker images (15-20MB standard, 5-8MB optimized)

### Environment Variables

Required:
- `PROXY_SERVER_URL`: Publicly accessible URL where this addon runs
- `TORRENTIO_URL`: User's configured Torrentio addon URL (with RD API key embedded)

Optional:
- `API_KEY`: Requires all requests to include `?api_key=xxx` parameter
- `PORT`: Server port (default: 13470)

### Security

**Authentication** (when `API_KEY` is set):
- All requests must include `api_key` query parameter matching the configured value
- Constant-time comparison using `subtle::ConstantTimeEq` (prevents timing attacks)
- Failed authentication returns HTTP 403 Forbidden
- Rewritten stream URLs automatically include the `api_key` parameter

**SSRF Protection**:
- `TORRENTIO_URL` validated against domain whitelist at startup
- Prevents proxy from being used to access arbitrary internal/external systems
- Allowed domains: torrentio.strem.fun, torrentio.strem.io, torrentio-debrid.cloud

**Path Traversal Protection**:
- All paths sanitized before processing
- Rejects `..` and `//` patterns
- URL-decodes paths before validation to catch encoded traversal attempts
- Allows only alphanumeric characters and URL-safe symbols

**See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for comprehensive security documentation.**

### Caching Strategy

The `resolvedUrlCache` Map stores Real-Debrid direct URLs by their path component. On cache hit that returns 404, the cache entry is invalidated and the URL is re-resolved from Torrentio. This handles expired RD links gracefully.

### Error Handling

- Missing environment variables: Process exits with error code 1
- Failed Torrentio API calls: Returns empty streams array
- Failed RD URL resolution: Returns 502 Bad Gateway
- Stream timeout (5 min idle): AbortController terminates the request
- 404 on cached URL: Automatic retry with fresh resolution

## Important Notes

- Compiled binary with minimal memory footprint (~2-5MB runtime)
- Stateless implementation except for in-memory URL caching
- URL rewrites target Real-Debrid streams only (`/realdebrid/` in URL)
- The proxy endpoint uses `/resolve/realdebrid/*` path
- Stream timeout is hardcoded to 5 minutes (`TIMEOUT_DURATION` constant in src/main.rs:17)
- Cache automatically evicts entries after 1 hour (URL cache) or 5 minutes (lock cache)
- All security features enabled by default (SSRF protection, path validation, log sanitization)

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies (Minimal Feature Set)
- **axum**: Modern web framework (HTTP1 only, minimal features)
- **tokio**: Async runtime (features: rt-multi-thread, net, time, macros, sync)
- **reqwest**: HTTP client (streaming, HTTP1 only, rustls-tls)
- **moka**: Production-grade LRU cache with TTL (replaces DashMap)
- **mimalloc**: Memory-efficient allocator
- **subtle**: Constant-time comparison for cryptographic operations
- **tower-http**: Middleware (CORS only)

### Memory Optimizations

**Code Level:**
- **MiMalloc allocator**: Replaces default allocator for better memory efficiency
- **Bounded cache**: Max 1000 entries with automatic eviction
- **Minimal logging**: Only errors in production, debug info in development
- **Reduced connection pooling**: Max 2 idle connections per host
- **HTTP/1 only**: Disabled HTTP/2 to save memory
- **Minimal tokio features**: Only essential runtime components
- **Static string optimization**: Using `replacen` and `trim_end_matches` instead of regex

**Build Optimizations:**
- **opt-level = "z"**: Optimize for size
- **lto = true**: Link-time optimization
- **codegen-units = 1**: Better optimization at cost of compile time
- **strip = true**: Strip debug symbols
- **panic = "abort"**: Smaller panic handler

**Docker Images:**
1. **Dockerfile.rust** (Standard): ~15-20MB Alpine-based image
2. **Dockerfile.optimized** (Ultra-minimal): ~5-8MB with UPX compression + scratch base

### Performance Benefits
- **Memory**: 1-3MB runtime (with mimalloc and optimizations)
- **Startup**: <1ms
- **Binary size**: ~2-3MB (stripped), ~1MB (with UPX)
- **Docker image**: 5-20MB depending on Dockerfile choice
- Zero-cost abstractions with Rust's ownership system
- Lock-free cache access with DashMap
- Memory-efficient streaming without buffering
- Fully static binary with musl (no runtime dependencies)

### Logging
Logging is minimal by default to reduce memory allocations:
- Production: Only errors and warnings
- Debug builds: All request logging enabled

Set `RUST_LOG` environment variable to override:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
RUST_LOG=torrentio_debrid_proxy=trace cargo run
```
